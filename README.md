Sometimes we just want to eat an unhealthy snack or skip a gym day but when is the right time to do this? The answer is when you have earned it and this program will help remind you when that is! 

When the user is conflicted or confused whether or not they have reached their predetermined deadline they can use this program as a recap to check if they have to wait long enough to earn their treat. 

The program achieves this by presenting questions to the user. Depending on how the user responds and what the user's predestined wait period is the program will determine if they have waited long enough.
